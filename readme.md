# Irie Vibes back to the Roots Festival 2022

Irie Vibes Roots Festival is coming back in 2022 with another edition of the Back To The Roots theme. To facilitate this, we would like to create a new, fresh look for the next edition! It was about time.

## Goals set for this new design:
* Oversightly display for the customers, with minified versions for on-the-go use and easy navigation on the festival field
* Futureproofing the design to be administered by other people besides the web development team. *You never know what'll happen a year from now.*

## Third party software used:

1 [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)

2 [Subrion CMS](https://github.com/intelliants/subrion)
